# Fake News - Incremental Game

This game was an entry for the one hour game jam #29 (http://onehourgamejam.com/?page=jam&jam=93) with the theme of _Complete and utter nonsense_.

The original game (in the *1hgj* folder) actually took about 75 minutes to complete, and then I worked on improving it further for another hour or so. I figured the only kind of game I could pull off in such a short period of time would be an incremental game, and I thought the concept would be fitting both for the theme, and the current political climate.
